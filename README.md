# Docker-Python Start Point

A hello world app that can be used as a start point to develop a Python web application.

## Description

The example application provides three Docker containers:
* A development container to connect your IDE with and develop the application without installing dependencies in your local machine.
* A deployment container that exposes the web application.
* A test cointainer that runs mypy and pytest when building.
